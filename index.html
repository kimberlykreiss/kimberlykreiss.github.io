	<p>  My name is Kimberly Kreiss. I currently live in Washington, D.C. where I’m serving as a Senior Research Assistant in the Consumer and Community Research section of the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA) at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I graduated from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with
		 honors in 2017 where I majored in economics and minored in math and English. 
		 I’m interested in using data and empirical research to solve public policy problems.  
		 
			<br /> 
	
	<p>My current research interests include and are not limited to: 
			<ul>
					<li>consumer finance</li>
					<li>banking regulation and structure</li>
					<li>non-banking financial institutions</li>
					<li>urban economics</li>
			</ul>
	I am also interested in applying techniques from data science to construct novel datasets and answer 
	interesting questions. Some that I have been most interested in lately are natural language processing techniques, 
	geospatial visualizations, and both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.
