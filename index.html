	<p>  My name is Kimberly Kreiss. I currently live in Washington, D.C. where I’m serving as a Senior Research Assistant in the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA) at the Federal Reserve Board. I work at the intersection of economic research, data science and public policy. I graduated from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with honors in 2017 where I majored in economics and minored in math and English. I’m interested in using data and empirical research to solve public policy problems.  My research interests include consumer finance, banking regulation and structure, and urban economics. I’m also interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and mapping and geospatial analysis.
