<div class="blurb">
	<p>My name is Kimberly Kreiss. I currently live in Washington, D.C. where Iâ€™m serving as a Senior Research Assistant in the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA) at the Federal Reserve Board. I work at the intersection of economic research, data science and public policy. This is my personal website where you can find some more information about me including my background and interests, the work I do now, and where I hope to go. This site is mainly a place for useful bits of code, my own research and projects, and professional updates.
