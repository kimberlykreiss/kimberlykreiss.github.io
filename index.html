	<p>  My name is Kimberly Kreiss. I currently live in Washington, D.C. where I’m serving as a Senior Research Assistant in the Consumer and Community Research section of the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA) at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I graduated from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with honors in 2017 where I majored in economics and minored in math and English. I’m interested in using data and empirical research to solve public policy problems.  My research interests include consumer finance, banking regulation and structure, and urban economics. I’m also interested in natural language processing, machine learning, mapping and geospatial analysis.
