## Projects and Code    
My recent work has focused on mapping and geospatial analysis, text mining and natural language processing techniques, and applying machine learning techniques to ecomomic problems. I do most of my work in R or python.

[Machine Learning Final Project](ml_code.md)
* We used lending data from a microlender primarily operating in countries in Asia and Europe. We used 3 supervised learning techniques to predict whether a client would default on a loan. We find that a linear support vector machine and random forest work the best in predicting the default risk, although the performance can only be considered to be fair.
