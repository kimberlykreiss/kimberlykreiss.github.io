My recent work has focused on geospatial analysis, text mining and natural language processing techniques, and applications of machine learning. I do most of my work in R or python.

[Who Will Default on a Loan?](ml_code.md)
* We used lending data from a microlender primarily operating in countries in Asia and Europe. We used 3 supervised learning techniques to predict whether a client would default on a loan. We find that a linear support vector machine and random forest work the best in predicting the default risk, although the performance can only be considered to be fair.
