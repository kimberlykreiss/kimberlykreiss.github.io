## Projects and Code    
Check in here to see updates on my personal projects, research, and code. 

Recently, I have been most excited about (1) mapping and geospatial visualizations; (2) text mining and natural language processing techniques; and (3) interactive visualizations. I am also excited about functional programming and writing efficient and reproducable code. The latter continues to be a work in progress!
