My recent work has focused on geospatial analysis, text mining and natural language processing techniques, and applications of machine learning. I do most of my work in R or python.

[Who Will Default on a Loan?](ml_code.md)
* We used lending data from a microlender primarily operating in countries in Asia and Europe. We used 3 supervised learning techniques to predict whether a client would default on a loan. We find that a linear support vector machine and random forest work the best in predicting the default risk, although the performance can only be considered to be fair.  

[Asking Consumers about their Finances (slides)](GASP_slides.pdf)
* Previous research shows us a great deal about consumers' finances including assets, liabilities, and spending patterns, but tells us relatively little about how consumers understand and evaluate their own finances. This research asks what circumstances, life events, and attitudes are important for people when asked to describe why they view their financial wellbeing in a positive or negative light. We answer this question using data science techniques including machine learning, text analytics and natural language processing applied to over 10,000 write-in responses from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. Our data come from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking. Results suggest a strong link between physical health and financial wellbeing. 

[SHED-ing Light on Survey Data: Using R to Automate Production Process for the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking](DCR.pdf)
* I document production processes using R for the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking and show some custom-written functions to do this.
