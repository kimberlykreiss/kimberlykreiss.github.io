## Projects and Code    
Check in here to see updates on my personal projects, research, and code. I do most of my work in R or python. 

Here are some things I am most excited about and have been working on recently: 
*  Mapping and geospatial visualizations
*  Text mining and natural language processing techniques
*  Machine learning
*  Interactive visualizations

[Machine Learning Final Project](ml_code.md)
* This is the final project from my ML class in GWU's data science master's program. We used lending data from a microlender primarily operating in countries in Asia and Europe. We used supervised learning techniques to predict whether a client would default on a loan.
