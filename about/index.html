	<h1>About me.</h1>
	<p>I currently live in Washington, D.C. where I work as a research assistant. I am from a small beach town in New 		Jersey, and I graduated from Rutgers in May 2017 with an economics major and minors in mathematics and English. 
	<br />
	I am interested in economics, policy, and tech. I like to automate mundane tasks, do cool things with data, and make 		pretty maps. I have several research interests, but a few that I have been thinking about a lot lately are banking 		structure and regulation, consumer finance, and behavioral economics.
	<br />
In my free time, I like to cook and try new recipes, play chess, and stay active through a variety of activities. I enjoy hiking, volleyball, and sometimes running. .</p>
