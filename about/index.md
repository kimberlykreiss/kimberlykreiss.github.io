I completed my BA at Rutgers University-New Brunswick where I majored in economics and minored in math and English. I wrote my senior thesis under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl on how the entry of ridesharing services into an area affects arrest rates, for which I received high honors from the Economics Department. 

I am a clarinetist and played in several ensembles during my time in college including a clarinet ensemble, concert band, and symphony band. I was president of Chess Club in college, where I organized [USCF](https://new.uschess.org/home/)-rated tournaments, organized tournaments with other New Jersey Colleges, and secured funding to send our team to the [Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship](http://www.uschess.org/content/view/11967/694/). I am a USCF-rated chess player, and I try to play in tournaments a few times a year.
