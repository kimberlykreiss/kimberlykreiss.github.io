# Bio

I was born and grew up in a small town near the beach in New Jersey, about forty-five minutes outside of New York City. I did my first year of college at Boston University where I was a math major. I transferred to Rutgers University-New Brunswick my sophomore year, where I graduated with a major in economics and minors in mathematics and English. I moved to Washington, D.C. after graduation to work at the Federal Reserve Board. 

# Education 

I graduated cum laude from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in May 2017 with a major in economics and minors in mathematics and English. I graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a Paul Robeson scholar, and I received Departmental High Honors from the Economics Department for my senior thesis, titled “Uber and Crime: An Investigation of Uber Entry on Arrest Rates”. 

For my thesis, I worked under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl to investigate the effect of ridesharing services on arrest rates, with a specific focus on drunk driving. I focused on the entry of Uber into counties in California using two datasets. The first was a manually constructed dataset of the entry dates of various services such as UberX or UberPool into counties in California. I manually compiled this dataset using information from various news articles, including postings from Uber’s website. The second was a comprehensive dataset of over 16 million arrests in California from the time period of 2006-2015 containing details of each individual arrest (date and offense) demographic information of the arrestee (age, sex, and race), and limited information on the law enforcement disposition of the arrest. I received this data by mail from the California Department of Justice. After extensive data cleaning, I then created a unique panel dataset of aggregate arrests for different crimes for each county and each month over the time period of 2006-2015. Below is a graph I constructed from these two datasets showing the percent of the population of California living in a county with Uber service by the end of the time period.

I used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics as well as the United States Census Bureau to include control variables for population, unemployment rates, median household income, and the percent of each county living in poverty. My results suggest that ridesharing services may complement existing policy to reduce instances of drunk driving among young people and first time offenders. However, ridesharing services do not seem to have much of an effect on repeat offenders, a group that has consistently proved hard to deter. 

In addition to gaining significant programming and research experience with my senior thesis, I gained a well-rounded education focusing on applications of economic theory, programming and data analysis, and mathematical theory through advanced courses in the economics and math departments. Two of my other favorite courses in undergraduate were “Big Data & Forecasting” and “Programming in Java”. The former focused on basic concepts of forecasting, potential time series issues with forecasting economic variables, and how to implement forecasting techniques in R. The latter was the first level computer science course at Rutgers and emphasized algorithmic construction, object-oriented programming, data structures, recursion, and searching and sorting algorithms. This course has been incredibly useful in my current role which relies heavily on programming and data analysis. I took this course in my last year of studies and it really made me wish I had found computer science earlier! I also heavily enjoyed my time in courses in the English department at Rutgers, which gave me an invaluable toolkit for written and oral communication. My favorite class I took through the English department was a creative non-fiction writing class focusing on the art of memoir. 

I was very involved with extracurricular activities during my time in college as well. While I was at Boston University, I played in the Concert Band as well as a clarinet ensemble and at Rutgers I played in the Rutgers Symphony Band. I was heavily involved with the Rutgers Chess Club since I transferred to Rutgers in 2014. I was president of the Chess Club during my last year at Rutgers, and I worked with an incredible and dedicated team of other undergraduates and our faculty adviser to significantly increase our membership and presence on campus. I led efforts to hold social and recruiting events on campus as well as organize campus-wide USCF-rated chess tournaments and worked with our faculty adviser to play in events with other local colleges. I also worked to restructure the club and implement a separate chess team for students who were interested in competing regularly and securing funding to send our members to tournaments. During my time as president, we were able to secure funding for the first time to send our members to the Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship, a collegiate tournament where different colleges face each other as a team. The tournament is a national tournament held once a year in a different location in the United States. I am United States Chess Federation (USCF) rated chess player, and I try to go to chess tournaments at least a few times a year. Here is a nice position from a game I played in a tournament in December where I was playing black. It’s black to move, and there is a very clean and forced check mate in 2 moves. Do you see it?
