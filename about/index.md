I completed my BA at Rutgers University-New Brunswick where I majored in economics and minored in math and English. I wrote my senior thesis under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl on how the entry of ridesharing services into an area affects arrest rates, for which I received high honors from the Economics Department. I used a large and comprehensive dataset of individual arrests from the California Department of Justice from 2006-2015. My results suggest that ridesharing services may complement existing policy to reduce instances of drunk driving among young people and first time offenders. However, ridesharing services do not seem to have much of an effect on repeat offenders, a group that has consistently proved hard to deter. 

I am a clarinetist and played in several ensembles during my time in college including a clarinet ensemble, concert band, and symphony band. I was president of Chess Club in college, where I organized USCF-rated tournaments, organized tournaments with other New Jersey Colleges, and secured funding to send our team to the Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship. I am a USCF-rated chess player, and I try to play in tournaments a few times a year.
