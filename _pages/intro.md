##### Overview

I am a DPhil student in Social Data Science and Shirley Scholar at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/kim-kreiss/). My research interests are at the intersection of computational social science, labor economics, and causal inference. I combine large-scale novel datasets with social science theory, computational techniques, and causal inference methods to study how institutions, skills, and policy shape labour market outcomes.
