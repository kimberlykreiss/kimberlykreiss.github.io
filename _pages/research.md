My career interests lie at the intersection of economics, data science, and law. More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in using data and empirical research to solve public policy problems. I'm currently interested in topics relating to real estate finance, urban economics, and labor economics but also have previous experience and interest in topics relating to crime and criminal justice.

## Previous Research

During my time as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board, I assisted economists in my section with their research projects and worked on my own research. In my work, I contributed to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, an annual survey of U.S. adults, and an accompanying [Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201905.pdf). I wrote a [box](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-economic-well-being.htm#xbox1-textanalysisofself-assessedwel-49224777) in the chapter on economic well-beingin the 2019 report. I used text mining techniques to analyze open-ended write-in responses in the survey. Additionally, in the 2020 report, I was responsible for writing the [student loan chapter](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-student-loans-other-education-debt.htm), and incorporated additional analysis on student loan debt and financial wellbeing.

Additionally, I worked with Board economists, Erin Troland and Brigitte Roth Tran, for their research on Economic Vulnerability in Rural America: Consumer Credit and the Coal Boom-Bust in the 2000s. I maintained code on internal git repositories and prepared panel data of Equifax credit files (70+ GB).

Finally, I worked on two of my own independent research projects. The first uses text mining and natural language processing techniques to extract information from an open-ended response question in this year's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking. I used regression, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to extract words and phrases most predictive of a respondent's economic wellbeing. I presented this work at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Government Advances in Statistical Programming (GASP) workshop, which you can find [here](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/GASP_slides.pdf). My second research project investigates the geospatial patterns in mortgage lending and how these lending patterns affect access to credit for low- and moderate-income consumers and communities.

In addition to the GASP workshop, I've presented my work at various conferences and events including the [DC R Conference](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/DCR.pdf) and internal Board events including the data showcase.
