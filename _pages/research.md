My career interests lie at the intersection of social policy, data science, and economics. Below are some policy research projects I worked:

During my time as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board, I assisted economists in my section with their research projects and worked on my own research. In my work, I contributed to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, an annual survey of U.S. adults, and an accompanying [Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201905.pdf). I wrote a [box](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-economic-well-being.htm#xbox1-textanalysisofself-assessedwel-49224777) in the chapter on economic wellbeing in the 2019 report. I used text mining techniques to analyze open-ended write-in responses in the survey. Additionally, in the 2020 report, I was responsible for writing the [student loan chapter](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-student-loans-other-education-debt.htm), and incorporated additional analysis on student loan debt and financial wellbeing.

As a research assistant, I supported Board economists and other researchers with their research projects. I have worked on projects focusing on the effect of tax policy on wages, economic recovery in places with many credit-constrained borrowers, and the gig economy and womenâ€™s retirement.

I have also led my own independent research projects, which I continue to do in my current role as a Data Scientist. As an example, in one research project, I use text mining and natural language processing techniques to extract information from an open-ended response question in this year's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking. I used regression, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to extract words and phrases most predictive of a respondent's economic wellbeing. I presented this work at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Government Advances in Statistical Programming (GASP) workshop, which you can find [here](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/GASP_slides.pdf). Most recently I have led research investigating where bank branches have closed during COVID-19 and discussed implications for consumer financial services access.

In addition to the GASP workshop, I've presented my work at various conferences and events including the [DC R Conference](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/DCR.pdf) and internal Board events including the data showcase. I have also spoken on panels focused on careers in data science and public policy through Rutgers University and Data Community DC. -->
