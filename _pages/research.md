My career interests lie at the intersection of public policy, data science, and economics. More broadly, I’m interested in using data and empirical research to solve public policy problems. I'm currently interested in topics relating to credit access, housing, and labor economics. I also have previous experience and interest in topics relating to crime and criminal justice.

## Previous Research

During my time as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board, I assisted economists in my section with their research projects and worked on my own research. In my work, I contributed to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, an annual survey of U.S. adults, and an accompanying [Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201905.pdf). I wrote a [box](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-economic-well-being.htm#xbox1-textanalysisofself-assessedwel-49224777) in the chapter on economic wellbeing in the 2019 report. I used text mining techniques to analyze open-ended write-in responses in the survey. Additionally, in the 2020 report, I was responsible for writing the [student loan chapter](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-student-loans-other-education-debt.htm), and incorporated additional analysis on student loan debt and financial wellbeing.

As a research assistant, I supported Board economists and other researchers with their research projects. I have worked on projects focusing on the effect of tax policy on wages, economic recovery in places with many credit-constrained borrowers, and the gig economy and women’s retirement.

I have also led my own independent research projects, which I continue to do in my current role as a Data Scientist. As an example, in one research project, I use text mining and natural language processing techniques to extract information from an open-ended response question in this year's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking. I used regression, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to extract words and phrases most predictive of a respondent's economic wellbeing. I presented this work at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Government Advances in Statistical Programming (GASP) workshop, which you can find [here](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/GASP_slides.pdf). Most recently I have led research investigating where bank branches have closed during COVID-19 and discussed implications for consumer financial services access.

In addition to the GASP workshop, I've presented my work at various conferences and events including the [DC R Conference](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/DCR.pdf) and internal Board events including the data showcase. I have also spoken on panels focused on careers in data science and public policy through Rutgers University and Data Community DC.
