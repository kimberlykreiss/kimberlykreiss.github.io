#### Projects 
+ *For Trenton, By Trenton - Building Excellence at the James Kerney Campus. *Capstone Project for Princeton University's Master's in Public Affairs.* 2024. [(PDF)]({{ site.baseurl }}/capstone_project_SPIA.pdf) 
  + Capstone project working with Mercer County Community College to provide recommendations to help implement their economic and workforce development goals at the James Kerney Campus in Trenton.

+ *Flowing Forward: A Reproducible Workflow for Studying Groundwater Changes in the Colorado River Basin and Beyond*. Project from University of Washington's Data Science For Social Good Summer Fellowship Program. 2023. [(link)](https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2023-Groundwater/) 
  + We developed an accessible and open data science workflow for making estimates of groundwater change publicly available. We use data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission – a complex dataset requiring significant technical expertise. Our workflow allows users to download, process, merge, and interpret complex hydrological data, including GRACE data, to derive estimates of groundwater anomalies over time. This tool can enable interdisciplinary research and public policy decisions reflective of large-scale and long-term groundwater dynamics.
