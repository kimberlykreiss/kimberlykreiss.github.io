#### About Me 

I’m currently a DPhil student in **Social Data Science** and a **Shirley Scholar** at the Oxford Internet Institute. My work sits at the intersection of **computational social science**, **labour economics**, and **causal inference**. I study how institutions, skills, and policy shape labor market outcomes using large-scale, novel datasets.

Previously, I earned an **MPA in Economics & Public Policy** from **Princeton University** where I also completed a graduate certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning. Before that, I worked for several years in applied research and data science roles across the public and non-profit sectors, including the **Federal Reserve Board**, the **Burning Glass Institute**, and most recently, the **Lithuanian Government**.

#### Research focus
- **Skills & institutions:** effects of skills-based hiring policies, credential requirements, and changing returns to education.  
- **Technology & inequality:** diffusion of AI/automation and distributional impacts across occupations, regions, and socioeconomic groups.  
- **Migration & mobility:** labor migration, integration, and the political economy of mobility.  
- **Novel Data Sources:** leverage vast amounts of data from online labor market data and other novel sources of data to answer policy-relevant questions
- **Methods:** quasi-experimental designs (DiD, event studies, synthetic control), text-as-data/NLP, network analysis, machine learning, and causal inference.
