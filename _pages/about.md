title: About Me
subtitle: I am currently working as a Data Scientist in the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). My section uses data and research to inform the Board about the economic conditions facing low- and moderate-income communities.

## Education

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with high honors from the Economics Department in 2017. I majored in economics and minored in mathematics and English. I wrote my senior thesis under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl on how the entry of ridesharing services into an area affects arrest rates. I am a clarinetist and played in several ensembles during my time in college including a clarinet ensemble, concert band, and symphony band. I was president of Chess Club in college, and I am a USCF-rated chess player.

While working at the Federal Reserve, I have taken graduate-level coursework in data science, geography, and economics.

## Current Role

Finally, I volunteer at the Board. Specifically, I assist in the Board and Howard University's Economics Department collaborative course on Expository Data Analysis with R for Howard students. I have led volunteer staff R trainings, have prepared and taught lectures, graded homework, and held office hours for students with programming issues and questions. I have taken advantage of several trainings for myself in data science and computation, including training through the Data Incubator, District Data Labs, General Assembly, and internal Board programs. I also took Machine Learning through George Washington University's data science master's program.

## Previous experience
In my work, I contribute to the Federal Reserve's [Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking](https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm), an annual survey of U.S. adults, and an accompanying [Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201905.pdf). My responsibilities include support of survey question design, data management, and production of the report. Specifically, I write and maintain code in Stata and R to analyze data for the report. This year I also helped develop new R programs to automate our production of tables and charts, as well as migrate our production work to internal git repositories. I wrote a [box](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-economic-well-being.htm#xbox1-textanalysisofself-assessedwel-49224777) in the chapter on [economic well-being](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-economic-well-being.htm) in this year's report. I used text mining techniques to analyze open-ended write-in responses in the survey.

I am also doing quantitative analysis of geospatial patterns in mortgage lending. For this project, I work closely with data scientists in my division to document and maintain our internal git repositories. I support economists to produce memos, presentations, and research papers.

I am currently the research assistant for Board economists, Erin Troland and Brigitte Roth Tran, for their research on Economic Vulnerability in Rural America: Consumer Credit and the Coal Boom-Bust in the 2000s. I maintain code on internal git repositories and prepare panel data of Equifax credit files (70+ GB). I use R and a high performance linux clusters to conduct this analysis.

I am currently working on two of my own independent research projects. The first uses text mining and natural language processing techniques to extract information from an open-ended response question in this yearâs Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking. Mike Zabek, also in my section, is now working with me to extend my analysis and co-author a Feds Note. We are using regression and machine learning techniques to extract words and phrases most predictive of a respondent's economic wellbeing. My second research project investigates the geospatial patterns in lending and how these lending patterns access to credit for low- and moderate-income consumers and communities.

Finally, I volunteer at the Board. Specifically, I assist in the Board and Howard University's Economics Department collaborative course on Expository Data Analysis with R for Howard students. I have led volunteer staff R trainings, have prepared and taught lectures, graded homework, and held office hours for students with programming issues and questions.
