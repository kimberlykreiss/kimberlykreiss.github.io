My career interests lie at the intersection of economics, data science, and law. More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in using data and empirical research to solve public policy problems. I'm currently interested in topics relating to consumer finance, banking regulation and structure, the role of non-banking financial institutions in mortgage markets, and urban economics.

Moreover, I am also interested in applying techniques from data science and statistics to construct novel datasets for policy-relevant issues. Some that I have been most interested in lately are natural language processing techniques, geospatial analysis, and effective visualizations.
