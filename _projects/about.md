I am currently working as a Data Scientist in the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). My section uses data and research to inform the Board about the economic conditions facing low- and moderate-income communities.
## Education

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with high honors from the Economics Department in 2017. I majored in economics and minored in mathematics and English. I wrote my senior thesis under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl on how the entry of ridesharing services into an area affects arrest rates. I am a clarinetist and played in several ensembles during my time in college including a clarinet ensemble, concert band, and symphony band. I was president of Chess Club in college, and I am a USCF-rated chess player.

While working at the Federal Reserve, I have taken graduate-level coursework in data science, geography, and economics.

## Current Role

In my current role as a Data Scientist, I work collaboratively to use data and research to support the Board's regulatory responsibilities, policy development functions and community development work. My most recent projects have focused on topics related to credit access, employment, and housing. I am an avid R Shiny user and have recently designed dashboards to visualize trends and changes in small dollar mortgage lending and  monitor conditions for low- and moderate- income communities. I've recently lead the development of an R package to easily analyze and prepare data from the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking's annual report.

I also currently work on my own research projects. Most recently, I conducted a geospatial analysis of bank branches and mortgage lending, access to credit, and housing. In my most recent work, I conducted a geospatial analysis of bank branch closures from 2012-2017 and designed a model to assess how bank branch closures affect mortgage lending. I am currently working to analyze bank branch closures during COVID-19. For my information about previous research I have worked on, please see my [research page](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/research).

Finally, I am active in the Board R community and volunteer with the Board and Howard University's Economics Department collaborative course on Expository Data Analysis with R. I have led volunteer staff R trainings, have prepared and taught lectures, graded homework, and held office hours for students with programming issues and questions. Most recently, I have worked as a co-lead for the Project Committee which works to develop research projects for students and partner students with economists advisors. I am a key member for the Board's use-R group and work with colleagues across the Board to host R events.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running, camping, and hiking. I am an avid hiker and one of my favorite regions to hike is the Pacific Northwest--I try to visit at least once a year.
