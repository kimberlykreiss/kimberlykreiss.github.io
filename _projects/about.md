I am currently a graduate student at Princeton University, pursuing my Master's in Public Affairs (MPA) and concentrating in Economics and Public Policy. Prior to Princeton, I was working as a Data Scientist in the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA), where I worked to use data and research to inform the Board about the economic conditions facing low- and moderate-income communities.

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in 2017 with high honors from the Economics Department in 2017. I majored in economics and minored in mathematics and English. I wrote my senior thesis under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl on how the entry of ridesharing services into an area affects arrest rates in California. 

At Princeton, I'm interested in exploring policy areas related to labor, inequality, and economic empowerment. I'm a [Graduate Associate](https://jrc.princeton.edu/people/kreiss) with the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and an [Environmental Policy Associate](https://cpree.princeton.edu/people/kimberly-kreiss) with the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment. I am also pursuing a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning, and I am currently a [Graduate Fellow in Social Data Science](https://ddss.princeton.edu/people/kimberly-kreiss) with the Data Driven Social Science Institute. In this role, I co-founded Princeton's first R group where I organize and host technical workshops, lightning talks, and invited speaker series talks focused on using R for advanced computational social science and policy research. In my free time, I enjoy biking, volleyball, and hiking.
