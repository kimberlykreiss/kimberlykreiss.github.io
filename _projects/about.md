I am currently working as a Data Scientist in the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). My section uses data and research to inform the Board about the economic conditions facing low- and moderate-income communities.
## Education

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with high honors from the Economics Department in 2017. I majored in economics and minored in mathematics and English. I wrote my senior thesis under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl on how the entry of ridesharing services into an area affects arrest rates. I am a clarinetist and played in several ensembles during my time in college including a clarinet ensemble, concert band, and symphony band. I was president of Chess Club in college, and I am a USCF-rated chess player.

While working at the Federal Reserve, I have taken graduate-level coursework in data science, geography, and economics at the George Washington University, and most recently, The New School.

## Current Role

In my current role, I work closely with colleagues to support DCCA's mission of conducting research to inform the Board's regulatory and policy development functions and support its consumer outreach and community development work. My most recent projects have focused on topics related to credit access, employment, and housing. I have recently worked to design an R Shiny dashboard to visualize changes and trends in small dollar mortgage lending, which I have presented to senior leadership and other stakeholders at the Board. I am currently working on a project to produce analysis and design an R Shiny dashboard to monitor conditions for low- and moderate- income communities using credit, housing, and employment data. Finally, I've recently lead the development of an R package to easily analyze and prepare data from the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking's annual report.

I also currently work on my own research projects. Most recently, I have worked on projects relating to geospatial analysis of bank branches and mortgage lending, access to credit, and housing. In my most recent work, I conducted a geospatial analysis of bank branch closures from 2012-2017 and designed a model to assess how bank branch closures affect mortgage lending. I am currently working to analyze bank branch closures during COVID-19. For my information about previous research I have worked on, please see my [research page](https://kimberlykreiss.github.io/research).

Finally, I am active in the Board R community and volunteer with the Board and Howard University's Economics Department collaborative course on Expository Data Analysis with R. I have led volunteer staff R trainings, have prepared and taught lectures, graded homework, and held office hours for students with programming issues and questions. Most recently, I have worked as a co-lead for the Project Committee which works to develop research projects for students and partner students with economists advisors. I am a key member for the Board's use-R group and work with colleagues across the Board to host R events.
