I am currently working as a Data Scientist in the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). My section uses data and research to inform the Board about the economic conditions facing low- and moderate-income communities.
## Education

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers University-New Brunswick with high honors from the Economics Department in 2017. I majored in economics and minored in mathematics and English. I wrote my senior thesis under Professor Anne Morrison Piehl on how the entry of ridesharing services into an area affects arrest rates. I am a clarinetist and played in several ensembles during my time in college including a clarinet ensemble, concert band, and symphony band. I was president of Chess Club in college, and I am a USCF-rated chess player.

While working at the Federal Reserve, I have taken graduate-level coursework in data science, geography, and economics at the George Washington University, and most recently, The New School.

## Current Role

In my current role, I work on topics related to credit access, housing, and employment.  

Finally, I volunteer at the Board. Specifically, I assist in the Board and Howard University's Economics Department collaborative course on Expository Data Analysis with R for Howard students. I have led volunteer staff R trainings, have prepared and taught lectures, graded homework, and held office hours for students with programming issues and questions. Most recently, I have worked as a co-lead for the Project Committee which works to develop research projects for students and partner students with economists advisors.  I have taken advantage of several trainings for myself in data science and computation, including training through the Data Incubator, District Data Labs, General Assembly, and internal Board programs.
